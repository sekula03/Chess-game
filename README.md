# Chess-game
Coded in Java, this project is made up of 2 parts: server and client/game. Both parts are multi-threaded. 
# Server project
is a regular Java project that runs the server thread, accepting and communicating with clients. It also implements Stockfish module* so players are able to play against bots.
*Github has a size limit so the module is not present in this repository
# Game project 
is done in JavaFX. It has game logic and client thread that communicates with the server.
